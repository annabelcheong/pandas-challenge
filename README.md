The two observable trends based on the data is that overall percentage of students passing Math and Reading is only 65%. 
Perhaps an unexpected trend is such that as the budget spent on each student increases, the % students passing the subjects decreases; that is applicable for % Passing Math, % Passing Reading and % Overall Passing.
Another interesting trend is that when the number of students at a school increases, in particularly when there are over 2000 students, the overall passing percentages decreases significantly. School sizes less than 2000 have % Overall Passing of approximately 90%. For schools above 2000 students, the % Overall Passing dips to approximately 57%.
Charter schools perform significantly better than District Schools based on overall percentage comparisons. District schools perform signficantly poorer in Math.
